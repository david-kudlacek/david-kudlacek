### Welcome to my corner

I am a freshman year student at FIT CTU in Prague. My interest lies in modern technology, but also interpersonal communication. I value my connections and colleagues, who inspire me to continue learning.

I have enrolled at the faculty because of my interest in the field of informatics. After the first semester, I have learned the basics of the C programming language, Linux and Shell scripting in Bash.

Most importantly, I have been able to network and learn how to communicate and negotiate, which has led to me taking an active interest in the faculty, where I now assist with events.

I aspire to learn Linux administration and grow my scripting skills, which I have grown passionate about.
